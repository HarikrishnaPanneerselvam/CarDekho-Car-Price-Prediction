## Car Price Prediction Project 🚗💰

## Dataset Overview 📊

Source: Car Dheko data, spanning multiple cities with features such as make, model, year, fuel type, transmission type, and more.

Structure: The dataset is structured with columns representing car features and target prices. It includes data from various cities, offering a diverse and comprehensive dataset for analysis.

## Project Workflow 🛠️

## 1. Data Processing 🔄

Concatenation: Merged datasets from multiple cities into one cohesive, structured dataset.

Missing Value Handling: Applied imputation techniques for both numerical and categorical data to ensure completeness and consistency.

Standardization: Normalized and cleaned the data by:

Converting units where necessary.

Encoding categorical values using appropriate techniques (e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding).

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔍

Visualization: Conducted detailed analyses using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn to identify patterns and trends in the data.

Feature Selection: Highlighted key features influencing car prices, such as:

Car Age: Older cars generally have lower prices.

Mileage: Lower mileage often corresponds to higher value.

Fuel Type & Transmission: Preferences for fuel type (e.g., petrol, diesel) and transmission (e.g., manual, automatic) vary by region and influence pricing.

## 3. Model Development 🤖

Algorithms: Implemented and trained multiple regression models, including:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

Gradient Boosting Regressor

Hyperparameter Tuning: Used Grid Search and cross-validation to optimize model parameters, ensuring the best performance.

## 4. Model Evaluation and Optimization 📈

Metrics: Evaluated model performance using:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures average error in predictions.

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Penalizes larger errors more heavily.

R-Squared Score: Indicates the proportion of variance explained by the model.

Feature Engineering: Enhanced model accuracy by:

Creating derived features like "Car Age" from the manufacturing year.

Grouping less frequent categories to avoid sparsity.

## 5. Deployment 🚀

Streamlit Application: Developed a real-time price prediction web application featuring:

Simple User Inputs: Users can input car details like make, model, year, fuel type, mileage, etc.

Instant Prediction: Provides real-time car price estimates based on user input.

User-Friendly Design: An intuitive and responsive interface tailored for customers and sales teams.

Customization Options: Allows users to adjust parameters for fine-tuned predictions.

## Results and Deliverables 🏆

Machine Learning Model: Built a highly accurate prediction model with excellent performance on test data.

Interactive Application: Deployed a user-friendly Streamlit tool for estimating car prices efficiently.

Comprehensive Documentation: Delivered detailed explanations of the methodology, including:

Data preprocessing techniques.

Feature engineering strategies.

Model development and tuning processes.

## Key Insights 💡

Features such as car age, mileage, and condition significantly impact price predictions.

Robust data preprocessing, including handling missing values and standardizing features, was crucial for achieving high accuracy.

The Streamlit app bridges the gap between technical predictions and user accessibility, making car price predictions effortless and engaging for end users.
