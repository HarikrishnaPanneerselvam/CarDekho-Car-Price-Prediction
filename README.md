## üõ†Ô∏è Techniques and Methodology

### **Data Processing**
1. **Import and Concatenate**  
   - Import unstructured datasets from multiple cities.
   - Convert into a structured format and add a `City` column.
   - Merge datasets into a single cohesive dataset.
   
2. **Handling Missing Values**  
   - Use mean, median, or mode for numerical columns.
   - Apply mode imputation or create new categories for categorical columns.

3. **Standardizing Data Formats**  
   - Normalize inconsistent formats (e.g., remove units like `kms`).
   - Ensure data types are consistent across features.

4. **Encoding Categorical Variables**  
   - Use one-hot encoding for nominal variables.
   - Apply label/ordinal encoding for ordinal variables.

5. **Normalizing Numerical Features**  
   - Use Min-Max Scaling or Standard Scaling to normalize features.

6. **Outlier Removal**  
   - Detect and handle outliers using techniques like IQR or Z-score analysis.

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Descriptive Statistics**  
  - Compute mean, median, mode, and standard deviation to understand data distribution.
  
- **Data Visualization**  
  - Create scatter plots, histograms, box plots, and correlation heatmaps to identify trends and relationships.

- **Feature Selection**  
  - Identify significant features using correlation analysis, feature importance metrics, and domain expertise.

---

### **Model Development**
1. **Train-Test Split**  
   - Split the dataset (e.g., 80-20) for training and testing.

2. **Model Selection**  
   - Experiment with algorithms such as:
     - Linear Regression
     - Decision Trees
     - Random Forests
     - Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)

3. **Model Training**  
   - Use cross-validation to ensure robust performance.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**  
   - Optimize parameters using Grid Search or Random Search techniques.

---

### **Model Evaluation**
- Evaluate models using metrics like:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R-squared
- Compare performance to select the best model.

---

### **Optimization**
1. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Create or transform features to enhance model performance.

2. **Regularization**  
   - Prevent overfitting using Lasso (L1) or Ridge (L2) regularization techniques.

---

## üåê Deployment
1. **Streamlit Application**  
   - Build a user-friendly interface where users can input car features and get real-time price predictions.

2. **Interactive Features**  
   - Clear input forms with validation and error handling.
   - Display predicted car prices instantly.
